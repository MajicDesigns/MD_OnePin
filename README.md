# Library for lightweight One Pin serial link interface

[![arduino-library-badge](https://www.ardu-badge.com/badge/MD_OneWire.svg?)](https://www.ardu-badge.com/MD_OnePin)

This library is designed to provide a lightweight software-only 
implementation for a single wire serial point-to-point link between 
two devices.

OnePin uses a single digital I/O line and ground to communicate 
between a primary and a secondary device. The primary always initiates 
and controls the communication. 

This link interface is useful to implement simple message transfers 
between a primary device and a less capable secondary device, such as 
custom sensors or actuators with simple processor control.
